# Adaptive Digital Assistant (A.D.A.)

## Overview

This organization hosts repositories related to the A.D.A. project, a Raspberry
Pi-based initiative focused on system programming, hardware interfacing, and
intelligent device development. The project aims to create a flexible and
intelligent device that can adapt to different scenarios through the use of
sensors, buttons, LEDs, and remote control mechanisms.

## Repository Structure

- [core](https://github.com/adasuit/core):
Contains the core logic and functionality of the A.D.A. project, serving as the
backbone for hardware interaction and system programming.

- [coreC](https://github.com/adasuit/core-C):
Historical repository showcasing the initial backbone of the A.D.A. project,
written in C. This repository serves as an artifact of an earlier
implementation.

- [circuit](https://github.com/adasuit/circuit):
Central repository for hardware schematics, datasheets, and documentation
related to electronic components used in the A.D.A. project.

- [deploy](https://github.com/adasuit/deploy):
Repository containing instructions, scripts, and configurations for setting up
and installing the A.D.A. project on various hardware configurations.
