AxiomSync is a smart glove technology that wirelessly triggers customisable
actions on various devices. The name combines "Axiom", a self-evident truth,
with "Sync", representing the synchronisation of movement and technology. This
reflects the goal of making intuitive control a fundamental aspect of
interacting with devices.

The system is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for easy expansion.
Custom actions can be created, devices and services integrated, and new features
added as needed.
