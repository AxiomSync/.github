# CyWear

### Overview

CyWear, short for Cyber Wearable Gadget, is a smart glove designed to wirelessly
trigger customisable actions on various devices. The main goal is to create a
modular platform that allows for easy and intuitive control of different digital
devices.

The system is designed to be flexible and can be expanded as needed.
This means that custom actions can be created, different devices and services
can be integrated, and new features can be added when required. By focusing on a
clear structure and modular design, CyWear ensures that the system is easy to
modify and scale without needing major changes to the core design.
